System that scan code.

What is the point of this project?

The programers of today are lazy and wanting to work on the good stuff. However, 
the reality is that we need secure system and sometimes the programer not acknowledge that he have unsecure code!!

So, our solution is to give the programer the ability to download extension in vscode and it will scan is code in real time and notify him about unsecure code in his own code and the programer will get a suggestion how to fix the problem.
